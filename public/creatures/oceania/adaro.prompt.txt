Original: Solomon Islands Adaro malevolent sea spirit from Melanesian mythology, humanoid upper 
body merging into powerful fish tail below, shark-like dorsal fin growing from top of 
head, gills visible on neck, grey-blue skin with bioluminescent markings, holding 
poisonous flying fish as throwing weapons in each hand, riding along a rainbow arc over 
turquoise tropical Pacific ocean, volcanic tropical island with palm trees in background, 
threatening dark storm clouds gathering on one side contrasting with rainbow on other, 
tropical ocean blues with threatening storm grey and rainbow prismatic accents

Revised: Depict a malevolent sea spirit from Melanesian mythology indigenous to the Solomon Islands. This creature perfectly blends the features of a man and a fish. Its upper part is humanoid, whereas its lower part morphs into a strong fish tail. It has a shark-like dorsal fin that springs from the crown of its head. Recognizable gills are located on its neck, and it has a grey-blue skin marked with bioluminescent patterns. Both its hands are clutching poisonous flying fish that serve as projectile weapons. Its milieu is a beautiful, turquoise, tropical Pacific ocean. It's riding along a rainbow's arc, with a volcanic tropical island teeming with palm trees discernable in the backdrop. One side of the scene displays threatening dark storm clouds that sharply contrast with the rainbow on the other side. The color scheme is heavily based on blues of the tropical ocean combined with the grey of the threatening storm and vibrant tones of the rainbow. Please render this scene in a semi-realistic style reminiscent of webtoon concept art, with dramatic cinematic lighting. Pay close attention to a high quality professional illustration, a rich color palette, dynamic composition and a dark atmospheric background. The resolution should be 4K.
