Original: Maori Taniwha water guardian, massive serpentine dragon-like creature with dark green 
scales covered in intricate Maori ta moko (tattoo) spiral patterns (koru designs), 
carved pounamu (greenstone/jade) horns, powerful coiled body emerging from a sacred 
New Zealand river surrounded by towering native silver ferns and ancient podocarp trees, 
glowing spiritual green energy (mauri) pulsing through tattoo patterns, water swirling 
around body in supernatural patterns, lush native bush (Aotearoa forest), deep ocean 
teal and jade green palette with bioluminescent accents

Revised: A massive serpentine dragon-like Taniwha water guardian, integral to Maori mythology, manifests from a sacred river in New Zealand. Karved pounamu, or greenstone horns, crown its dark green-scaled body, which is intricately decorated with koru designs - spiral patterns symbolic of Maori ta moko tattoos. The guardian's powerful coiled form emerges amid towering native silver ferns and venerable podocarp trees typical of the Aotearoa forest. A shimmering green spiritual energy, or mauri, pulses through the tattoo patterns. The water around the creature swirls supernaturally. The color palette is an immersive blend of deep ocean teal, jade green, and bioluminescent accents, used in a semi-realistic webtoon concept art style. Drama is invoked with cinematic lighting while the background maintains a dark and atmospheric ambiance.
