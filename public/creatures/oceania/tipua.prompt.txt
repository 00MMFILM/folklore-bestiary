Original: Maori Tipua nature spirit, ancient massive kauri tree coming alive with a face emerging 
from the trunk bark showing traditional Maori carving (whakairo) style features — 
spiraling koru patterns forming eyes, tiki-like mouth in the grain, root-like arms 
reaching outward from the trunk with finger-like branches, glowing green spiritual 
energy (wairua) pulsing through every ring and branch, sacred New Zealand old-growth 
forest clearing with native ferns, mosses, and epiphytes, misty ethereal atmosphere, 
shafts of golden-green light through canopy, ancient forest green and warm 
living-wood brown palette

Revised: Visualize a scene from ancient New Zealand folklore, where a massive kauri tree comes alive as a Maori Tipua nature spirit. The bark of the tree breaks open to reveal a face, its features are reminiscent of traditional Maori carving, with spiraling koru patterns forming it's eyes, and a tiki-like mouth shaped in the grain of the wood. Root-like arms extend from the trunk, and branches shaped like fingers reach out. A radiant green energy pulses through each ring and every branch of the tree, emphasizing its spiritual essence. This all happens within an old-growth forest clearing, native ferns, mosses, and epiphytes adding to the mystical atmosphere. The environment is shrouded in a misty aura, with shafts of golden-green light piercing through the canopy. Employ a color palette emphasizing forest green and warm living-wood brown shades. This ethereal and spiritual scene is to be rendered in semi-realistic webtoon concept art style, with cinematic lighting, high detail, and a dark atmospheric background. The composition should be dynamic, dramatic, and rich in color, with the artwork being in 4K quality.
