Original: Australian Bunyip from Aboriginal Dreamtime mythology, bizarre amalgamation creature 
with dark matted fur on a seal-like body, horse-like head with walrus tusks, webbed 
clawed feet, and a long thick tail, emerging from the murky waters of an Australian 
billabong (waterhole) at dusk, jaws open in a terrifying bellow, red Australian outback 
landscape reflected in still dark water, gum trees (eucalyptus) and reeds surrounding 
the waterhole, brilliant southern hemisphere stars appearing overhead, dusty ochre red 
and murky brown-green water palette

Revised: Depict a scene from Australian Aboriginal Dreamtime mythology featuring the Bunyip, a cryptid creature with characteristics of various animals. Imagine it as having a seal-like body covered in dark matted fur, a horse-like head accented with walrus tusks, and webbed feet bearing sharp claws. It also has a long, thick tail. Show it emerging from the murky waters of a traditional Australian billabong at dusk, its jaws open in a petrifying roar. Let the red Australian outback landscape reflect in the still dark waters, with gum trees and reeds surrounding the waterhole. Include brilliant stars of the southern hemisphere appearing overhead in the evening sky. Use a primary color palette of dusty ochre red and murky brown-green for the water, taking inspiration from the natural Australian environment. Apply concept art style nested with elements of realism for a semi-realistic webtoon representation. Refer to professional illustrations for high detailed aspects. Arrange this in a dynamic composition, with atmospheric lighting adding to the dramatic element of the scene, ensuring the overall backdrop remains dark and atmospheric. Ensure a rich color palette and a 4K quality finish.
