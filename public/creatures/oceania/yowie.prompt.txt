Original: Australian Yowie cryptid from Aboriginal accounts, massive ape-like humanoid (over 2.5 
meters tall) covered in dark reddish-brown coarse fur, powerful muscular build with 
disproportionately long arms, flat broad face with deep-set intelligent amber eyes 
reflecting a distant campfire's light, heavy brow ridge, lurking at the very edge of 
dense Australian bush at twilight — half hidden behind eucalyptus trunk, body partially 
obscured by undergrowth suggesting something seen from corner of eye, Blue Mountains 
terrain with sandstone cliffs and rugged bushland, deep twilight purple and bushland 
green palette with warm amber eye reflection as focal point

Revised: Depict a scene showcasing a massive humanoid cryptid, a creature embedded in Aboriginal folklore. This figure, standing over 2.5 meters tall, is akin to a grand and intimidating ape. Its muscular build is cloaked in dark reddish-brown coarse fur, arms disproportionately long. The face is broad and flat, displaying deep-set intelligent amber eyes that reflect the light of a remote campfire. A heavy brow ridge crowns the visage. The creature is partially hidden behind a eucalyptus trunk on the border of thick Australian bush at twilight. The body is partially covered by undergrowth, suggesting a sight only visible when looked at from the corner of one's eye. The scene is set amidst the terrain of the Blue Mountains, displaying sandstone cliffs under a deep twilight purple sky, and patches of rugged bushland. The illustration should observe a warm amber eye reflection as the focal point. The artwork requires a high level of professional detail, expressing the cryptid in a semi-realistic webtoon concept, with a rich color palette. The composition should appear dynamic with deep atmospheric background—olive green bushland against the lavender twilight. The whole piece must be provided in 4K resolution, with a dramatic and cinematic lighting setup.
