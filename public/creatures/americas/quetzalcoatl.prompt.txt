Revised: The image features Quetzalcoatl, the Aztec Feathered Serpent god, as a massive sinuous serpentine figure. Its dragon-like body is covered in iridescent quetzal feathers that blend emerald green and brilliant gold. Over its head, it dons an intricate carved stone Aztec headdress adorned with jade and turquoise inlays. With its feathered wings spread magnificently, Quetzalcoatl coils around an ancient Mesoamerican stepped pyramid illustrated in a Teotihuacan style. It exudes a divine golden light influencing the entire scene. Along its body, there are turquoise jade ornaments and golden rings as decorations. The pyramid is seated in a lush jungle, visible from a bird's eye view. Above, the sky unveils a dramatic sunset, as clouds part to reveal deep hues of gold that contrast the hint of turquoise in the landscape below. The style of the image skews towards semi-realistic webtoon concept art, amplified by dark atmospheric backgrounds and dynamic composition. This high-detail professional illustration uses a rich color palette, featuring deep emerald and turquoise among other shades, providing a 4K quality.
