Revised: Chupacabra, a mythical creature often described as a hairless reptilian-canine hybrid, draped in grey-blue scaly skin, with a row of sharp bony spines adorning its hunched back. Its large oval red eyes reflect the ghostly glow of the moonlight. An elongated snout filled with sharp fangs further escalates its predatory profile. Its powerful kangaroo-like hind legs are prepared for leaping, as it crouches in a dusty, rural Caribbean farmland under the night sky. Adding to the scene are a wooden fence and lush tropical vegetation. A single harsh moonbeam illuminates the creature, creating an eerie and unsettling ambiance featuring a muted grey-blue palette. This high detail professional illustration manifests itself in a semi-realistic webtoon concept art style with dramatic cinematic lighting. The cryptid illustration plays with dark atmospheric backgrounds and a rich color palette. The dynamic composition of the scene is captured in 4K quality.
