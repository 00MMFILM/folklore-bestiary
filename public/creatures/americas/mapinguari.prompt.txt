Original: Brazilian Mapinguari, massive prehistoric ground-sloth-like beast standing upright (over 
3 meters), covered in thick matted dark reddish-brown fur, single large cyclops eye 
with intelligent malice, enormous gaping secondary mouth on its belly with sharp teeth, 
huge curved claws on powerful arms, towering over dense Amazon rainforest understory, 
visible green stench waves radiating from body with insects fleeing, broken trees and 
trampled vegetation in its wake, oppressive humid tropical atmosphere, lush green jungle 
with earthy brown and warning red accents

Revised: Depict an image of the mythical creature from Brazilian folklore called Mapinguari. Make this creature massive in size, resembling a ground sloth standing more than 3 meters tall and covered in thick, matted, dark reddish-brown fur. It should have a large cyclops eye that projects an intelligent, malicious glare. A distinctive characteristic should be a wide secondary mouth located on its belly, filled with sharp teeth. Its arms should display huge curved claws demonstrating sheer strength. Set in the dense understory of the Amazon rainforest, with broken trees and trampled plants signifying its passage. It should exude visible green stench waves with insects fleeing from it, suggesting a manifestation of considerable repulsion. Decorate the scene with a humid, oppressive tropical atmosphere combined with lush green visuals of the jungle punctuated by earthy brown and vivid red accents. The art style should resemble semi-realistic webtoon concepts emphasizing dramatic cinematic lighting. The whole design should be a high detailed professional illustration featuring a dark atmospheric background that effectively contrasts a rich color palette. Carry out these elements harmoniously to ensure a dynamic composition expressed in a 4K-quality image.
