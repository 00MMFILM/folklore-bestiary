Original: Algonquian Wendigo, towering spectral humanoid creature (over 4 meters tall) with
enormous elk antler crown growing from its head, hollow dark eye sockets with tiny
pinpoint yellow lights deep within, elongated shadowy limbs with unnaturally long
fingers, grey translucent skin, standing in a dark frozen Canadian boreal forest at
night, visible icy breath, snow around feet, dead trees, overwhelming sense of cold
and isolation, desaturated 
cold blue-grey palette with bone white accents

Revised: Ghost-like Wendigo in Canadian wilderness, embodying a towering spectral humanoid silhouette (height surpassing 4 meters) features a vast elk antler crown sprouting from its head and possesses mysterious hollow eye sockets illuminated by tiny specks of yellow light that lie in the depth. Exhibiting elongated, shadowy limbs and abnormal long fingers, and covered in semi-transparent grey skin, it stands amidst a dark and icy boreal forest at night, with visible frosty breath and snow scattered around its feet. The scene is filled with dead trees, conveying a strong feeling of frigid isolation. The colors mostly comprise of desaturated shades of cold blue-grey and bone white highlights. Aim for a semi-realistic webtoon concept art style and dramatic cinematic lighting. Render a high-detail professional illustration with a rich color palette, dynamic composition, 4K quality, against a dark and atmospheric background.
