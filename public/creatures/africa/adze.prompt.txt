Original: West African Adze vampire spirit from Ewe mythology, dual-form transformation scene: 
large supernatural firefly with sinister pulsing amber-red glow transitioning into a 
hunched dark humanoid figure with glowing amber eyes and sharp teeth emerging from the 
light, West African village with traditional round thatched-roof huts at deep night, 
palm trees silhouetted against starry sky, trail of bioluminescent light between forms, 
sleeping villager visible through doorway, warm threatening amber glow against deep 
midnight blue atmosphere

Revised: In a West African village with traditional round thatch-roofed huts under a starry sky, present a scene depicting the transformation of an Adze spirit from Ewe mythology. Initially, it's a large supernatural firefly with a menacing, pulsating amber-red glow, transitioning into a crouched, dark, humanoid figure with glowing amber eyes and sharp teeth, emerging from the light. Against the deep midnight blue atmosphere, palm trees are silhouetted, with a trail of bioluminescent light linking the two forms. A villager, unaware of the impending doom, sleeps peacefully visible through a doorway. The scene is depicted in a semi-realistic style similar to webtoon concept art. The composition is dynamic, with a rich color palette, dramatic cinematic lighting, and high-level professional illustration, scaled up to 4K resolution.
