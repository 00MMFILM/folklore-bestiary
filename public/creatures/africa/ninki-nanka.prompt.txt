Revised: In the midst of a heavily dense West African coastal wetland, a fantasy creature inspired by Gambian folklore emerges from the dark mangrove swamp. It's a massive serpent-dragon hybrid with an extremely long sinuous neck rising from the murky water. Bearing a horse-like head with three curved horns and a crest of fins, the creature has large glowing yellow-green eyes with vertical slit pupils. The creature's iridescent dark green-black scales reflect the dim moonlight, as its body partially submerges showing enormous coils in the dark water. The scene boasts a mysterious humid atmosphere with twisted mangrove roots and has a swamp green and dark water color palette. The artwork embraces a semi-realistic style, dramatic cinematic lighting, and a rich color palette. It presents a dynamic composition that captures the essence of concept art often seen in webtoons. This professional illustration has a high level of detail and a dark atmospheric background with 4K quality.
