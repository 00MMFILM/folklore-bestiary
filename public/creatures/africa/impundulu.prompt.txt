Original: South African Lightning Bird Impundulu from Xhosa/Zulu mythology, massive supernatural 
raptor-like bird with jet-black and electric-white plumage, crackling with visible 
electricity and lightning arcs along its wingspan, brilliant lightning bolts striking 
from its extended wingtips down to the ground, sharp blood-stained talons, fierce 
glowing white eyes with inner lightning, silhouetted against a dramatic violet-black 
thunderstorm over South African grassland savanna, rain falling in sheets, 
electric white and stormy deep purple palette with lightning flash illumination

Revised: Depict a representation of South African Lightning Bird Impundulu. This raptor-like bird from Xhosa/Zulu mythology is massive, with a combination of jet-black and electric-white plumage that crackles with visible electricity and arcs of lightning along its wingspan. Visualize brilliant lightning bolts striking from the bird's extended wingtips down to the ground. Its talons are sharp and appear to be stained with blood. The creature has fierce, glowing white eyes that have an inner lightning effect. This impressive figure is silhouetted against a dramatic violet-black thunderstorm over the South African grassland savanna. Rain is falling heavily, contributing to the scene's intensity. The color palette for this image consists primarily of electric white and stormy deep purple hues, and lighting flashes sporadically illuminate the scene. This image should be depicted in a semi-realistic webtoon concept art style, but with high detail and professional quality. Choose a dark, atmospheric background, use a rich color palette and ensure the composition is dynamic. The requested resolution is 4K.
