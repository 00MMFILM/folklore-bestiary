Original: Tanzanian Popobawa, terrifying shadow entity with enormous leathery bat wings spread 
wide (spanning entire width of image), single large cyclopean glowing crimson eye in 
center of dark amorphous head, body made of living shadow and dark smoke with barely 
visible clawed hands reaching out, hovering menacingly above Zanzibar Stone Town 
rooftops at deep night, ornate Swahili carved wooden doors and white coral-stone 
architecture below, citizens' oil lanterns flickering with fear, pure black and deep 
blood-red color palette with minimal detail in shadows

Revised: Picture a terrifying shadow-like creature from Tanzanian mythology, the Popobawa. Its gigantic leathery bat wings span across the entire width of the image, creating a powerful and eerie silhouette in the deep night sky. From the center of its dark, amorphous head beams a single, large crimson eye, glowing ominously. Its body, made of living shadow and smoky darkness, appears vague yet menacing, with subtle indications of terrifying claws reaching out. The creature hovers menacingly above the rooftops of Zanzibar's Stone Town, represented by intricate Swahili carved wooden doors and stunning white coral-stone architecture. The town's inhabitants have lit their oil lanterns, their lights flickering with a fearful anticipation. The image primarily uses a deep, dramatic palette of pure black and blood-red, minimally illuminating the consuming shadows for a daunting atmosphere. The art style should be a blend of semi-realism and webtoon aesthetics for a dynamic and engaging composition.
