Original: South African Tokoloshe from Zulu mythology, small malevolent water dwarf (about 1 meter 
tall) with wizened dark leathery skin, oversized bald head with hollow dark eye sockets 
and a mouth full of sharp crooked teeth in a malicious grin, carrying bone charms and 
fetish pouches, dripping with river water, emerging from murky river water at night near 
a traditional South African homestead, bed raised on bricks visible through window 
(traditional protection against Tokoloshe), murky water green and midnight blue atmosphere 
with unsettling stillness

Revised: Visualize a creature from Zulu mythology, the South African Tokoloshe. This is a malevolent dwarf, only about 1 meter tall, with dark, aged, and leather-like skin. He has an oversized and bald head, with eyes as dark and hollow as night. His malicious grin reveals a set of sharp, off-kilter teeth. He is adorned with bone charms and carries fetish pouches, dripping with the water from the river he emerges from at nighttime. In the background, near a traditional South African dwelling, you can catch a glimpse of a bed raised on bricks through a window, a common method of protection against the Tokoloshe. The atmosphere is captured in shades of murky green and midnight blue, creating an unsettling stillness in the scene. The style is akin to the semi-realistic art found in webtoons, with dramatic, cinematic lighting illuminating the scene in high definition. Attention should be paid to the fine details of the illustration and a rich color palette should be used, aiming for a dynamic composition. The scene is in 4K quality.
