Revised: A Chinese hopping vampire, or Jiangshi, rigidly stands as a reanimated corpse. It is garbed in dark blue Qing dynasty Mandarin official court robes featuring embroidered rank badges. The Jiangshi's arms jut out stiffly. Adorned on its forehead is a yellow paper talisman emblazoned with red Chinese calligraphy. The morbid figure’s pale greenish-grey skin showcases dark veins lacing its surface while long, sharp fingernails claw from its fingertips and sickly green eyes glow ominously. The setting is a foggy Chinese graveyard filled with traditional spirit walls and timeworn tombstones while an unnerving green phosphorescent mist swirls around its feet. The vibe of the image is captured in a semi-realistic webtoon concept art style, with a dramatic cinematic lighting adding weight to the scene. Overall, this illustration is of high detail, set against a dark atmospheric background with a rich color palette and dynamic composition in 4K quality.
