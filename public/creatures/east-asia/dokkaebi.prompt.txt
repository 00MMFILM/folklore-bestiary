Original: Korean Dokkaebi goblin spirit, muscular humanoid figure with a SINGLE horn on forehead, 
holding a magical iron club (bangmangi), mischievous knowing grin with sharp teeth, 
surrounded by floating blue ghost flames (dokkaebi-bul), wearing rugged traditional Korean 
armor with tiger-pelt shoulders, standing in a moonlit Korean mountain path with ancient 
pine trees, ethereal blue and teal color palette

Revised: Create a high-detail professional illustration of a Korean Dokkaebi goblin spirit in a semi-realistic webtoon concept art style. The spirit should be a muscular humanoid figure with a single horn on its forehead, sporting a mischievous knowing grin with sharp teeth. It's holding a magical iron club known as bangmangi. The figure is surrounded by floating blue ghost flames, referred to as dokkaebi-bul, and is dressed in rugged traditional Korean armor that features tiger-pelt shoulders. The setting is a moonlit Korean mountain path adorned with ancient pine trees, with a dark atmospheric background. The color palette should be rich and specifically ethereal blue and teal, with an innovative, dynamic composition. The image should be created to 4K Quality and features dramatic cinematic lighting.
