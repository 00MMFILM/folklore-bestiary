Revised: Create an image that depicts a grand, 4K quality scene set in the barren landscape of the Gobi desert. In this scene, a gigantic Olgoi-Khorkhoi, a mythical creature from Mongolian folklore, is seen emerging from the sand. This creature resembles a massive segmented worm that spans 3 meters in length and is a deep shade of crimson. It possesses an eyeless head with a circular mouth. As it breaks through the desert floor, the force of its emergence generates an enormous sand explosion at the point of emergence. This spectacle is backed by an atmospheric background with dramatic, billowing dust clouds that stretch across the horizon. Adding a sense of otherworldly power, the worm's body has electrical arcs and lightning crackling around it, lit by the harsh desert sunlight to create a dramatic, cinematic lighting effect. The image is rendered in a semi-realistic webtoon concept art style signifying fantasy creature illustration. It has rich color palette, dynamic composition, and is meticulously detailed, showcasing a professional illustration.
