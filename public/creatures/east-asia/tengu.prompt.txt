Original: Japanese Tengu mountain demon, tall imposing figure with long red nose (daitengu form) 
and fierce crimson face, massive black crow wings spread wide, wearing traditional 
yamabushi mountain priest robes with pom-pom sash, wielding a hauchiwa feather fan 
that commands wind, perched on a twisted ancient pine branch on a misty Japanese 
mountain peak, torii gate visible in fog below, dramatic wind effects swirling leaves

Revised: Depict an imposing figure of a Japanese Tengu, in its tall daitengu form with a long red nose and a fierce crimson face. The creature has massive black crow wings spread wide and is dressed in traditional yamabushi mountain priest robes complete with a pom-pom sash. It wields a hauchiwa feather fan that commands the wind. The Tengu is perched on an ancient, twisted pine branch situated high on a misty Japanese mountain peak. Below, a torii gate can be faintly seen through the fog. Dramatic wind effects are swirling leaves around the scene. Should be presented in a semi-realistic webtoon concept art style with dramatic cinematic lighting. The image should be a high detailed professional illustration with a dark atmospheric background, a rich color palette, and a dynamic composition. The required resolution of the image is 4K.
