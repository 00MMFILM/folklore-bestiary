Revised: A depiction of a Korean mythological creature, the Gumiho, in semi-human form, portraying an elegant woman with slight vulpine features, such as slightly pointed ears and amber fox eyes with slit pupils. She has nine luminous white fox tails spreading elegantly behind her. Her attire consists of a flowing white hanbok with a crimson inner lining. Held between slender fingers is a glowing blue fox bead, known as yeowoo-guseul in Korean folklore. This figure stands in a moonlit bamboo forest that exudes an ethereal and mysterious atmosphere. The silver moonlight casts long shadows, adding to the dark atmospheric background. The art style to be used is a semi-realistic approach as seen in webtoon concept art, making use of dramatic cinematic lighting. The illustration should be high detail reminiscent of professional artwork, rich in color and dynamic in composition. Make the image quality fit for a 4K display.
