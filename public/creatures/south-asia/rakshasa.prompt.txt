Revised: A powerful, symbolic scene featuring a Rakshasa from Hindu mythology. This multi-armed (four arms) humanoid is depicted with dark blue-tinged skin, tiger-like fangs and a glowing, vertical third eye on the forehead. Dressed in ornate, dark royal Indian jewellery composed of heavy gold and dark gems, the rakshasa also wears an elaborate crown. Each of its curved talons holds different items: a curved sword, a sacred cup, an orb of power, and a ball of magical flame. The creature is seated on an ancient dark throne in an underground palace, surrounded by intricately carved Dravidian pillars. The whole scene has a predominant palette of deep royal purple and tarnished gold, rendered in a semi-realistic webtoon concept art style with dramatic, cinematic lighting. High-detail professional illustration, with a dark atmospheric background, rich color palette, dynamic composition, and 4K image quality.
