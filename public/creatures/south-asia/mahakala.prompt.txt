Revised: A detailed depiction of the Mahakala, a revered deity in Nepalese folklore. This powerful figure, dressed in a rich, dark blue-black hue, commands attention with three intense eyes, with the third eye on the forehead. Clad in a crown of ancient ornaments, Mahakala boasts a wild, flaming, orange head of hair standing upright along with a fierce, fanged expression. Six arms express his might, each arm wielding a different ritual implement including a trident, a sacred cup, a damaru drum, a sword, a ritual blade, and a lasso. The deity is wreathed in sacred flames and smoke, adorned with a garland of sacred beads and a tiger skin loincloth. Set in the backdrop is a mountainous cliff displaying an austere Himalayan Buddhist monastery or gompa. Tibetan prayer flags flutter colorfully in the wind, adding an authentic touch of culture. Mahakala's body contrasts against the flame orange and white. The work is a fusion of the classic style of a Buddhist Thangka painting and modern fantasy art rendered in a semi-realistic webtoon concept art style. The scene is illuminated in dramatic cinematic lighting that highlights the intricate details of the professional illustration against the dark, atmospheric background. The dynamic composition uses a rich color palette and is presented in 4K quality.
