Original: Mystical Indian forest spirit inspired by Baital folklore, a luminous ethereal figure
sitting on a giant ancient banyan tree branch at dusk, glowing white eyes full of
ancient wisdom, flowing grey robes and long dark hair moving in supernatural wind,
surrounded by floating spirit orbs, ancient Indian stone ruins overgrown with vines
in background, magical twilight atmosphere with warm amber and cool silver tones,
Indian mythology inspired fantasy concept art, painterly style

Revised: A mystical forest spirit, originating from South Asian folklore, sits upon a large, ancient banyan tree at dusk. This figure glows with an ethereal light, its white eyes filled with enthralling wisdom. The spirit's flowing grey robes and long, dark hair sway mysteriously in an unseen wind. Surrounding the spirit are floating orbs, adding to the otherworldly scene. The background features stone ruins from times forgotten, overgrown with tenacious vines. The palate of the scene harmonizes warm amber and cool silver tones, heavily inspired by Indian mythology. This semi-realistic, high-detailed professional illustration in 4K quality employs painterly techniques to create a dark, atmospheric background, rich color palette, and dynamic composition, resembling early 20th-century fantastical concept art.
