Revised: A powerful, muscular humanoid figure, acting as a Yaksha nature guardian spirit from Sri Lankan folklore. This imposing creature exhibits a green-tinged skin that's adorned with living vines, flowers, and moss growing from its body. Displaying regal, ancient Sinhalese styled golden crown with lotus motifs and boasting heavy golden jewelry like armlets, necklace, and anklets, this guardian's stern yet benevolent expression adds to its personality. It's seen guarding the entrance of a treasure-filled cave in a densely populated, lush tropical forest filled with exotic orchids and glowing bioluminescent plants. Giving the scene a sense of reverence, wild animals, including elephants and peacocks, surround the guardian. The palette bustles with warm emerald green and rich golds. This high-detail illustration is envisioned in a semi-realistic style that's common among webtoon concept art, with a hint of dramatic cinematic lighting striking upon the guardian. The background strikes a contrast with its dark, atmospheric touch against the guardian's vibrant form, making the composition dynamic and illustrative.
