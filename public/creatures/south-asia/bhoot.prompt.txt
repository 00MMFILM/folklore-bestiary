Original: South Asian Bhoot ghost, translucent pale female figure floating slightly above 
ground, feet distinctly turned BACKWARDS (key identifying feature), long unkempt dark 
hair partially covering face revealing one hollow dark eye and gaunt cheekbone, 
wearing a white funeral sari billowing in supernatural wind that affects nothing else, 
faint ghostly white glow emanating from body, hovering near an ancient massive banyan 
tree at a rural Bengali village crossroads at midnight, oil lamp flickering nearby, 
rice paddies reflecting moonlight in background, pale ghostly white against deep 
shadow contrast

Revised: The image portrays a South Asian Bhoot ghost. A pale, translucent female figure levitates just above the ground, her feet curiously facing backwards. Her long, dark, and disheveled hair partially covers her face, revealing one hollow, dark eye and a gaunt cheekbone. She wears a white funeral sari, stirring in a spectral wind that leaves its surroundings untouched, and a ghostly white glow emanates from her body. She hovers near an imposing ancient banyan tree at a crossroads in a rural Bengali village. Adding to the eerie ambiance, an oil lamp flickers nearby, and rice paddies glisten under the moonlight in the background. The pale ghostly glow contrasts starkly with the deep shadows. The image should be created in the style of semi-realistic webtoon concept art, with dramatic cinematic lighting effects. It should be a highly detailed, professional illustration, with a dark atmospheric background and a rich color palette. The composition should be dynamic, and the image quality should be 4K.
