Original: Slavic witch Baba Yaga, ancient fearsome crone with wild matted grey hair, iron teeth 
gleaming, long hooked nose with warts, piercing knowing eyes, flying through a dark 
Russian birch forest in a giant weathered wooden mortar using an enormous pestle as 
rudder, her iconic hut (izbushka) on two enormous chicken legs visible in the background 
among the trees, fence of human skulls on posts with glowing eye sockets lighting the 
path, sweeping away her trail with a silver birch broom, deep dark forest atmosphere 
with shafts of moonlight through birch canopy

Revised: Envision Baba Yaga, a mythical Slavic witch, captured in a semi-realistic webtoon concept art. She is an ancient crone with untamed grey hair, iron-like teeth that glisten, a protruding warped nose adorned with warts, and sharp discerning eyes. Set in a dusky birch forest in Russia, she is seen flying in a massive aged wooden mortar, steering with an enormous pestle as she leaves her iconic hut standing on two gigantic chicken legs among the trees. A fence made of human skulls on posts, featuring glowing eye sockets, illuminates the path. She is seen sweeping away her trail with a silver birch broom. The deep forest setting is enhanced by sporadic rays of moonlight piercing through the birch canopy. The overall reference should convey a dramatic cinematic lighting, display detailed elements, command a rich color palette, and employ a dynamic composition. The final illustration is expected to be in 4K quality, resonating a dark, atmospheric background.
