Original: Romanian Strigoi vampire (original Dracula folklore), gaunt aristocratic figure with 
deathly pale translucent skin showing dark branching veins underneath, blood-red eyes 
with vertical slit pupils, elongated canine fangs stained with fresh blood, wearing 
decayed ornate medieval Wallachian nobleman clothing (dark velvet with tarnished gold 
embroidery), long claw-like fingernails, emerging from a cracked stone sarcophagus in 
a Gothic Transylvanian crypt with dripping candles and cobwebs, bats swirling in 
background, deep crimson and shadow color palette

Revised: Visualize a Romanian Strigoi vampire, from original Dracula folklore. Depict this figure as gaunt and aristocratic, with deathly pale translucent skin that exposes dark, branching veins beneath. His eyes are blood-red with vertical, slit pupils and elongated canine fangs are stained with fresh blood. Clothed in decayed ornate medieval Wallachian nobleman attire, in dark velvet adorned with tarnished gold embroidery, he has long claw-like fingernails. The vampire emerges from a cracked stone sarcophagus in a Gothic Transylvanian crypt full of dripping candles and cobwebs, and bats engulf the background. The color palette leans towards deep crimson and shadow, using an artistic style reminiscent of semi-realistic webtoon concept art. Accentuate the piece with dramatic cinematic lighting and high detail to create a professional, atmospheric illustration. Achieve a rich color palette and dynamic composition in 4K quality.
