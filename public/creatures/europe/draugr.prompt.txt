Revised: Envision an ancient Norse Draugr, a Viking spirit warrior manifested as a massive spectral figure that is twice as large as a normal human. This ghostly entity has pale frost-blue skin and glowing ice-blue eyes, suggestive of an existence in a cold afterlife. They are wearing corroded Viking chainmail, adorned with ancient runes that tell tales of olden times. The Draugr sports an iron helmet and wields a broad, ancient sword. This phantom warrior stands as a sentinel, guarding a treasure-filled burial mound teeming with gold and weapons from the Viking era. The body radiates an icy frost, illustrating its frozen state. Above the scene, the northern lights, or the Aurora Borealis, shimmer in the Arctic sky, casting a magical radiance over the landscape. The color palette of the image should consist of cold, icy blue tones contrasted with the stark darkness of iron, intending to create a dark fantasy illustration. The art style should strike a balance between semi-realistic and webtoon concept art, with dramatic, cinematic illumination adding depth to the scenery. The artwork must be of high detail, demonstrating professional skills, and include an atmospheric, dark background. A rich color palette and a dynamic composition should contribute to the overall feel of the image. Ensure the quality of the image is 4K for clear and crisp representation.
