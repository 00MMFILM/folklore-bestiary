Original: Norse Kraken, colossal ancient octopus-like sea monster rising from dark stormy North Sea,
massive barnacle-encrusted tentacles (each thicker than a ship mast) wrapping around a
wooden Viking longship, one enormous ancient intelligent eye (size of a wagon wheel)
glowing beneath the waves, lightning illuminating the beast against stormy clouds,
mountainous waves, sense of incomprehensible scale with tiny ship versus enormous creature,
deep ocean blue-black and storm grey palette, epic fantasy illustration

Revised: Depict a scene inspired by Norse legend - a colossal sea monster similar to an ancient octopus rises from a dark, stormy North Sea. Its massive, barnacle-encrusted tentacles, each thicker than a ship mast, are coiling around a wooden Viking longship. A single enormous and intelligent eye, with the size of a wagon wheel, glows beneath the waves. Lightning strikes illuminate the creature against the backdrop of stormy clouds and mountainous waves. Convey a sense of incomprehensible scale by contrasting the tiny ship against the enormous creature. Use a deep ocean blue-black and storm grey color palette. This is to be created in an epic fantasy illustration style with dramatic lighting. As for the background, it should be dark and atmospheric. The color palette should be rich, and the composition dynamic. Quality is paramount, aim for a 4k quality, high-detail professional illustration.
