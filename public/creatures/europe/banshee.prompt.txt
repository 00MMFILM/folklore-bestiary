Original: Irish Banshee (Bean Sídhe), spectral wailing woman floating above ground, impossibly 
long flowing white hair whipping in supernatural wind, hollow black eye sockets streaming 
ghostly luminous tears, mouth open in an otherworldly piercing scream with visible sonic 
waves distorting the air, wearing a tattered ancient grey burial shroud and hooded cloak, 
translucent ghostly body, hovering over a Celtic graveyard with weathered stone crosses 
and round tower in background, thick Irish mist, monochromatic silver palette with pale 
blue spectral glow

Revised: An eerie scene captures a depiction of an Irish Banshee, traditionally referred to as a 'Bean Sídhe'. This ghostly figure, recognizable by her wailing, floats above the ground. Her impossibly long, white hair flows wildly, seemingly influenced by an otherworldly wind. The hollow sockets where eyes should be, stream ghostly luminous tears, offering a stark contrast to their dark surroundings. Her mouth is open, the imminent piercing scream visibly distorting the surrounding air with sonic waves. Dressed in an ancient, tattered, and grey burial shroud that includes a hooded cloak, she exudes a spectral glow through her translucent body. This supernatural entity can be seen hovering above a Celtic graveyard dotted with weathered stone crosses and a round tower in the backdrop, all under the shroud of a thick Irish mist. The monochromatic silver composition is broken only by the occasional spectral blue glow that washes over the scene. The lighting in this high-detail professional illustration has a cinematic quality, creating a dramatic, atmospheric background. With its rich color palette and dynamic composition, this concept art renders beautifully in 4K.
